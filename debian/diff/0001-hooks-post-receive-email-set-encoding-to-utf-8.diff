Subject: [PATCH 01/11] hooks/post-receive-email: set encoding to utf-8

Some email clients (e.g., claws-mail) display the message body
incorrectly when the charset is not defined explicitly in a
Content-Type header.  "git log" generates logs in UTF-8 encoding by
default, so add a Content-Type header declaring that encoding to
the emails the post-receive-email example hook sends.

[jn: also setting the Content-Transfer-Encoding so MTAs know what
 kind of mangling might be needed when sending to a non 8-bit clean
 SMTP host]
