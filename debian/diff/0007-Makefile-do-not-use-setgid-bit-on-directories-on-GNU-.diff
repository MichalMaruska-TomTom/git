Subject: [PATCH 07/15] Makefile: do not use setgid bit on directories on
 GNU/kFreeBSD

The g+s bit on directories to make group ownership inherited is a
SysVism; BSD and most of its descendants do not need that since they
do the sane thing by default without g+s.  Because of this, on some
filesystems (but not others), the kernel of FreeBSD does not allow
non-root users to set setgid bit on directories (tmpfs works that way;
UFS does not), causing errors when one tries:

	$ git init --shared dir
	fatal: Could not make /tmp/dir/.git/refs writable by group

Since the setgid semantics are there already without the setgid bit,
it's better to avoid setting it.  Since v1.5.5-rc0~59^2 (Do not use
GUID on dir in git init --share=all on FreeBSD, 2008-03-05), git on
true FreeBSD does exactly that; so set DIR_HAS_BSD_GROUP_SEMANTICS
when $(uname -s) is GNU/kFreeBSD to make sure machines that use a GNU
userland with the kernel of FreeBSD get the same fix.

This fixes t0001-init.sh and t1301-shared-repo.sh on GNU/kFreeBSD
when --root points to a directory that uses tmpfs.
