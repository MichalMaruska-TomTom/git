+Git v1.7.4.2 Release Notes
+==========================
+
+Fixes since v1.7.4.1
+--------------------
+
+ * Many documentation updates to match "git cmd -h" output and the
+   git-cmd manual page.
+
+ * "git clone /no/such/path" did not fail correctly.
+
+ * "git commit" did not correctly error out when the user asked to use a
+   non existent file as the commit message template.
+
+ * "git diff --stat -B" ran on binary files counted the changes in lines,
+   which was nonsensical.
+
+ * "git diff -M" opportunistically detected copies, which was not
+   necessarily a good thing, especially when it is internally run by
+   recursive merge.
+
+ * "git difftool" didn't tell (g)vimdiff that the files it is reading are
+   to be opened read-only.
+
+ * "git merge" didn't pay attention to prepare-commit-msg hook, even
+   though if a merge is conflicted and manually resolved, the subsequent
+   "git commit" would have triggered the hook, which was inconsistent.
+
+ * "git patch-id" (and commands like "format-patch --ignore-in-upstream"
+   that use it as their internal logic) handled changes to files that end
+   with incomplete lines incorrectly.
+
+ * The official value to tell "git push" to push the current branch back
+   to update the upstream branch it forked from is now called "upstream".
+   The old name "tracking" is and will be supported.
+
+ * gitweb's "highlight" interface mishandled tabs.
+
+ * gitweb had a few forward-incompatible syntactic constructs and
+   also used incorrect variable when showing the file mode in a diff.
+
+And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
